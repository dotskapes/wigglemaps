Historical Note:

WiggleMaps was developed for the dotSkapes Virtual Lab (dVL) with
support from the Gottesman Fund, Skoll Foundation, UW-Madison Global Health
Institute, EHA, Epidemico, and Kitware. The dVL was co-founded by Nico Preston 
and Zack Krejci in 2010.

The Wiggle Maps idea is partially derived from the other components of the dVL
including SaVaGeLib, map viewing client, dotLab and dotDash. The name
WiggleMaps is derived from WebGL ("WiGgLe") and an initial focus on spatial
representations of data ("Maps").

Previous versions of Wiggle Maps (<0.5) were licensed under MIT.

Starting with version 0.5, Wiggle Maps is distributed under the
Apache 2.0 License.
