**The dotSkapes Virtual Lab** has been under development since 2010. The WiggleMaps component dates from 2011. Our goal was to create a browser-based environment for rendering geovisualizations for global health data. WiggleMaps were recently used in a variety of projects including an infectious disease encyclopedia, a biosurveillance platform, and a visualization interface for global threats datasets.
