By leveraging WebGL, WiggleMaps extends geographical visualizations beyond current web mapping approaches. Unlike WMS solutions, layers can be fully styled at runtime to allow rich, interactive visualizations. Through portable Shapefile and GeoJSON readers, WiggleMaps brings multiple geographic data types to the web, allowing developers flexibility when deploying geodata in their applications.",
